# Releasing a new version of the security-profiles-operator

A new security-profiles-operator release can be done by overall three Pull Requests (PRs).
Please ensure that no other PRs got merged in between. This can be achieved by
opening a new `Release vx.y.z` issue and applying the `tide/merge-blocker` label
if appropriate.

The overall process should not take longer than a couple of minutes, but it is
required to have one of the repository [owners](./OWNERS) at hand to be able to
merge the PRs.

The first PR targets this repository and:

- bumps the [`VERSION`](VERSION) file to the target version
- changes the `images` `newName`/`newTag` fields of
  [./deploy/base/kustomization.yaml](deploy/base/kustomization.yaml) from
  `gcr.io/k8s-staging-sp-operator/security-profiles-operator` to
  `k8s.gcr.io/security-profiles-operator/security-profiles-operator` (`newName`) and the
  corresponding tag (`newTag`). After that the make target `make deployments`
  has to be run and the changes have to be committed.

After this PR has been merged, we have to watch out the successful build of the
container image via the automatically triggered
`post-security-profiles-operator-push-image` post submit job in prow. All jobs of this
type can be found either on the commit status on the master branch or [in prow
directly](https://prow.k8s.io/?job=post-security-profiles-operator-push-image).

If the image got built successfully, then we can create a second PR to [the
k8s.io GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io). This PR
promotes the built container images (the manifest as well as the builds for
`amd64` and `arm`).

We can use the tool
[`cip-mm`](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/cmd/cip-mm) to
allow easier retrieval and modification of the necessary container image digests.
To run the tool from `$GOPATH/src/k8s.io/release`, just execute:

```bash
> go run ./cmd/cip-mm/main.go \
    --base_dir ../k8s.io/k8s.gcr.io \
    --staging_repo gcr.io/k8s-staging-sp-operator \
    --filter_tag v0.x.0  # change the tag accordingly
```

This will modify the file
[`$GOPATH/src/k8s.io/k8s.io/k8s.gcr.io/images/k8s-staging-sp-operator/images.yaml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/blob/main/k8s.gcr.io/images/k8s-staging-sp-operator/images.yaml)
which can be now proposed as a new PR.

If this PR got merged, then we're finally ready to [create the
release](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/security-profiles-operator/releases/new)
directly on GitHub and add the release notes. The release notes can be generated
by the [official Kubernetes Release Notes
tool](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/cmd/release-notes).

After that, another PR against this repository has to be created, which:

- bumps the [`VERSION`](VERSION) file to the next minor version, but now including the
  suffix `-dev`, for example `1.0.0-dev`.
- changes the `images` `newName`/`newTag` fields in
  [./deploy/base/kustomization.yaml](deploy/base/kustomization.yaml) back to
  `gcr.io/k8s-staging-sp-operator/security-profiles-operator` (`newName`) and `latest`
  (`newTag`).

The last step about the release creation is to send a release announcement to
the [#security-profiles-operator Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/security-profiles-operator).
