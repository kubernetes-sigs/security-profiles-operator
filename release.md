# Releasing a new version of the security-profiles-operator

A new security-profiles-operator release can be done by overall three Pull Requests (PRs).
Please ensure that no other PRs got merged in between. This can be achieved by
opening a new `Release vx.y.z` issue and applying the `tide/merge-blocker` label
if appropriate.

The overall process should not take longer than a couple of minutes, but it is
required to have one of the repository [owners](./OWNERS) at hand to be able to
merge the PRs.

The first PR targets this repository and:

- bumps the [`VERSION`](VERSION) file to the target version
- changes the `images` `newName`/`newTag` fields of
  [./deploy/kustomize-deployment/kustomization.yaml](deploy/kustomize-deployment/kustomization.yaml)
  from `gcr.io/k8s-staging-sp-operator/security-profiles-operator` to
  `k8s.gcr.io/security-profiles-operator/security-profiles-operator` (`newName`) and the
  corresponding tag (`newTag`). After that the make target `make bundle`
  has to be run and the changes have to be committed.
- changes the `image` in the `CatalogSource` in the same way at
  [./examples/olm/install-resources.yaml](/examples/olm/install-resources.yaml)
- changes [`hack/ci/e2e-olm.sh`](/hack/ci/e2e-olm.sh) to sed
  `"s#k8s.gcr.io/security-profiles-operator/security-profiles-operator-catalog:v0.0.0#${CATALOG_IMG}#g"`
  instead of
  `"s#gcr.io/k8s-staging-sp-operator/security-profiles-operator-catalog:latest#${CATALOG_IMG}#g"`
  (please note to change the version `v0.0.0` to the upcoming release)
- updates [./dependencies.yaml](./dependencies.yaml) `spo-current` version as
  well as its linked files. Run `make verify-dependencies` to verify the
  results.

After this PR has been merged, we have to watch out the successful build of the
container image via the automatically triggered
`post-security-profiles-operator-push-image` post submit job in prow. All jobs of this
type can be found either on the commit status on the `main` branch or [in prow
directly](https://prow.k8s.io/?job=post-security-profiles-operator-push-image).

If the image got built successfully, then we can create a second PR to [the
k8s.io GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io). This PR
promotes the built container images (the manifest as well as the builds for
`amd64` and `arm`).

We can use the tool
[`kpromo`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/promo-tools#kpromo) to allow
easier retrieval and modification of the necessary container image digests.
To run the tool from `$GOPATH/src/sigs.k8s.io/promo-tools`, just execute:

```bash
> export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
> go run ./cmd/kpromo pr \
    --fork <YOUR_GH_USERNAME> \
    --project sp-operator \
    --reviewers "" \
    --image "" \
    --digests "" \
    --tag v0.x.y
```

This will automatically create a PR in the k/k8s.io repository. If this PR got
merged, then we're finally ready to [create the
release](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/security-profiles-operator/releases/new)
directly on GitHub and add the release notes. The release notes can be generated
by the [official Kubernetes Release Notes
tool](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/cmd/release-notes).

After that, another PR against this repository has to be created, which:

- bumps the [`VERSION`](VERSION) file to the next minor version, but now including the
  suffix `-dev`, for example `1.0.0-dev`.
- changes the `images` `newName`/`newTag` fields in
  [./deploy/kustomize-deployment/kustomization.yaml](deploy/kustomize-deployment/kustomization.yaml)
  back to `gcr.io/k8s-staging-sp-operator/security-profiles-operator`
  (`newName`) and `latest` (`newTag`) and runc `make bundle`
- changes the tag in the same way in the OLM example manifest at
  [./examples/olm/install-resources.yaml](/examples/olm/install-resources.yaml)
- reverts the changes to [`hack/ci/e2e-olm.sh`](/hack/ci/e2e-olm.sh)
- updates [./dependencies.yaml](./dependencies.yaml) `spo-current` version as
  well as its linked files. Run `make verify-dependencies` to verify the
  results.

Create a new pull requrest in the OperatorHub.io [community
operators](https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators) repository to
add the new version like in [this
PR](https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators/pull/1672).

The last step about the release creation is to send a release announcement to
the [#security-profiles-operator Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/security-profiles-operator).
