              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

                  DisableProfileAfterRecording indicates whether the profile should be disabled
                  after recording and thus skipped during reconcile. In case of SELinux profiles,
                  reconcile can take a significant amount of time and for all profiles might not be needed.
