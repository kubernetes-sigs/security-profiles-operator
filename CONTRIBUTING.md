# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to Kubernetes. We are excited about the prospect of you joining our
[community](https://git.k8s.io/community)! The Kubernetes community abides by
the CNCF [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md). Here is an excerpt:

_As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of
fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who
contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities._

## Getting Started
